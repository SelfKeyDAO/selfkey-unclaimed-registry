You expressly acknowledge, affirm, and agree that SelfKey DAO Foundation ("SelfKey"), or its licensors, as the case may be, is the sole and exclusive owner of all legal right, title, and interest in and to the software, source code, technical documentation, related algorithms, graphical user interfaces, graphical designs, architectures, structures, underlying technology, and any other materials contained in this repository, or any associated documentation, software, or code published or made available on any other platform or medium (collectively, the "Program"). The Program includes, but is not limited to, all works of authorship, inventions, discoveries, improvements, methods, processes, formulas, designs, techniques, and information, whether or not patentable or registrable under copyright or similar laws, and whether in written, electronic, coded or any other form. This ownership extends to all languages, formats, and platforms and covers all Intellectual Property Rights.

"Intellectual Property Rights" means any and all rights existing from time to time under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, unfair competition law, and any and all other proprietary rights worldwide. It also includes all applications, renewals, extensions and restorations thereof, now or hereafter in force and effect. The ownership of SelfKey applies regardless of whether such Intellectual Property Rights are registered or unregistered, and wherever in the world those rights may exist. You also acknowledge that the Program contains proprietary information that is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not limited to copyright.

PROHIBITION

Except as expressly permitted by this License or by applicable law, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you are expressly prohibited from, and shall not permit any third party to: distribute, transmit, publish, copy, modify, adapt, translate, prepare derivative works from, merge, combine with another program, incorporate into or on another product, offer for sale, sell, transfer, rent, lease, loan, export or re-export, reverse assemble, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code (if applicable regarding deriving the source code) of the Program, or any part thereof (the "Prohibition").

This Prohibition extends to any action intended to extract any proprietary information, including but not limited to algorithms, protocols, structures, ideas, principles, or elements contained in the Program, whether for your own use, for transfer to a third party, or for the creation of products or services that compete with or otherwise infringe upon the rights of SelfKey, its licensors, or the Program. Furthermore, you shall not remove, alter, cover, or distort any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notice on the Program or accompanying materials, and you shall not aid, abet, encourage, or induce any third party, directly or indirectly, to commit any of the acts described in this paragraph. Any attempt to do so is a violation of the rights of SelfKey and its licensors.

Under the Prohibition, you are expressly prohibited from using any trademark, service mark, trade name, logo, insignia, domain name, or any other distinguishing branding elements or intellectual property ("Marks") belonging to SelfKey, its licensors, or any other company or organization. The Prohibition applies, but is not limited to, instances where such use is likely or intended to cause confusion, deception, or misunderstanding about the identity, affiliation, connection, association, origin, sponsorship, endorsement, authorization, approval, or any relationship of any kind between you and the owner, authorized user, or other legally recognized party related to such Marks.

You may not use the Marks in a manner that tarnishes, degrades, disparages, or dilutes the quality associated with the Marks or the goods or services to which the Marks pertain. You may not use the Marks in any manner that infringes or encroaches upon the rights of SelfKey or any third party. Further, you may not use the Marks in any way in conjunction with content that is defamatory, scandalous, inflammatory, pornographic, profane, or in any manner that could damage or harm the reputation or goodwill associated with the Marks or their respective owners.

The Prohibition extends to the use of any Marks in any meta tags, keywords, or hidden text; using the Marks in any domain names, email addresses, or social media handles or identifiers; or registering, attempting to register, or assisting others in registering any Marks or names that are in any way similar to the Marks. Any unauthorized use of the Marks or any similarly confusing elements may constitute an infringement of SelfKey's or other rightful owners' valuable intellectual property rights, and may result in legal action.
